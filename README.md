# TooManyCookies
TooManyCookies is a python project that provides statistical analysis of a Cookie **Clicker** save **file.** Additionally, it will calculate the most optimal purchase given **the current save file.** **The goal is to maximize the number of cookies you can make with the current save file.**

## Usage
```python
python tmc.py [config_file] [save_file]
```

The program will output clean, org**anized data to the console.** **The data will be in the form of a table, with the first column being the name of the item, and the second column being the number of times that item was purchased.** (Editor's note: This is only kind of true, but I gave Copilot the W here)

## C**onfiguration**

A configuration **file is required. This file is a** YAML **file that contains** information about how the **program should calculate the optimal purchase.**

H**ere is an example configuration file:**

```yaml
---
# This is an example configuration file.
preferred_strategy: pure
iterations: 0
```

## Sa**ve File**

The save file should be a simple txt **file that contains** a single line **of text. This line should be the** output of the "Export **save" button in the Cookie Clicker game.**
